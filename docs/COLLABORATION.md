# Collaboration Protocol

This file is the single source of truth for coordinated work in repo `fnbapp`.
All agents read it at the start of every session.

Agents:

- Claude Code / GLM 5.1: coordination, specs, review, surgical fixes, tracking.
- Codex / GPT 5.6 family (`gpt-5.6-sol` frontier, `gpt-5.6-terra` balanced, `gpt-5.6-luna` fast, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`): engine, data correctness, migrations, audits, multi-file refactors.
- Antigravity / Gemini family (`Gemini 3.1 Pro` Low/High effort, `Gemini 3.5 Flash` Low/Medium/High, also Claude Sonnet/Opus 4.6 Thinking, GPT-OSS 120B): UI/frontend, responsive layouts, forms, visual QA.

Do not treat ownership as identity-based permission. Ownership follows risk boundary.

## A. File Map

Read before each session:

- `CLAUDE.md` section 0: Claude-specific project instructions.
- `AGENTS.md`: Codex and Antigravity project instructions.
- `docs/COLLABORATION.md`: this protocol.
- `README.md`: product/setup entry point and canonical documentation map.
- `CONTEXT.md`: current business context and scope.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: runtime architecture and trust boundaries.
- `docs/FEATURE-CATALOG.md`: feature status and verification evidence (population begins in Pre-Audit C).
- `docs/BUSINESS-RULES.md`: approved/observed/unresolved operating-rule index.
- `docs/ACCESS-MODEL.md`: intended roles versus observed/verified enforcement.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: **single source of truth for pending work + priorities**.
- `docs/COMPLETED.md`: compact archive of finished outcomes.
- `docs/TESTING.md`: test strategy, commands, risk gates, and known gaps.
- `docs/COLLABORATION.md`: ownership, workflow, review, and communication protocol.
- `DEVELOPMENT-TRACKING.md`: detailed chronicle log (newest first).

Supporting authority remains outside the ten entry documents when specialist detail is required:

- `docs/domain-dictionary.md`: terminology when changing labels, sheets, reports, or domain code.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-25-mac-cogs-inventory-design.md`: MAC/COGS policy and design detail.
- `docs/audits/2026-07-16-drive-backup-policy.md` and `docs/operations/apps-script-drive-backup.md`: backup policy and operation.
- `docs/audits/**`, `docs/handoffs/**`, and completed plans: historical evidence, not current entry-point authority unless explicitly labeled.

## B. Status Markers

- `[ ]` pending.
- `[~C]` in progress by Claude.
- `[~X]` in progress by Codex.
- `[~A]` in progress by Antigravity.
- `[x]` done and verified.
- `[!]` blocked or needs review.
- `[-]` deferred or wontfix.

Rules:

- Do not delete task items. Preserve audit trail.
- `[x]` needs a short note with who completed it and verification.
- `[!]` and `[-]` need a reason.
- Only one agent should own an in-progress task marker at a time.

## C. Risk-Boundary Ownership

### Engine Files

Codex owns these. If another agent touches them, Codex review is required.

- `lib/mac-cogs.ts`
- `lib/fifo-tracker.ts`
- `lib/inventory-consumption.ts`
- `lib/report-v2-allocators.ts`
- `lib/cogs-drift-audit.ts`
- `lib/mac-cogs-audit.ts`
- `lib/purchase-ledger-rebuild.ts`
- `scripts/*cogs*`
- `scripts/*ledger*`
- `scripts/audit-pnl-mac-consistency.ts`
- `app/admin/orders/actions.ts` transaction/order-mutation paths only.
- `app/pos/actions.ts` transaction paths only.

### Backup Files

Codex owns the backup architecture and its future maintenance (added 2026-07-16 per Stabilization Phase 2 close). Claude retains final architecture/policy approval. Any production restore or production data write still requires explicit reviewed dry-run/apply plan.

- `supabase/functions/backup-to-drive/**` (Edge Function snapshot endpoint)
- `scripts/apps-script/backup-to-drive.gs` (Apps Script pull-model script)
- `lib/drive-backup*.ts` and `lib/drive-backup*.test.ts` (contract/handler/integration tests)
- `docs/operations/apps-script-drive-backup.md` (owner setup runbook)
- Backup schema decisions: table allowlist, `schemaVersion` bumps, retention policy (daily/monthly split, counts)
- Drive folder layout, idempotency, capacity monitoring
- `BACKUP_PULL_TOKEN` rotation runbook
- Backup completeness audits and restore planning/verification
- Future Drive → R2/B2 migration when bundle reaches 25 MB threshold (or runtime > 90 sec, or Apps Script unreliability)

### UI Files

Antigravity owns these. Claude review is required before commit when the change is user-facing.

- `app/**/page.tsx`
- `app/**/components/*.tsx`
- `components/*`
- Form UX, responsive behavior, modal layout, visual QA.

If UI changes server actions or data flow, Codex review is also required.

### Spec And Protocol Files

Claude owns these. Codex review is required for engine/data claims.

- `docs/COLLABORATION.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/superpowers/specs/*`
- `DEVELOPMENT-TRACKING.md` is append-only unless cleanup is explicitly requested.

## D. Seven Coordination Rules

1. No silent data writes.
   - Any script that writes Google Sheets must support dry-run by default.
   - It must print exact counts and targets.
   - `--apply` is required for writes. No `--apply` means read-only.

2. Commit per phase.
   - One commit equals one outcome plus verification.
   - Do not mix UI, engine, and data migration in the same commit.

3. Cross-boundary review is required.
   - UI changing server action or data flow: Codex review.
   - Engine changing visible report UI: Antigravity or Claude review.
   - Spec/protocol change: Claude approval first, including Codex proposals.

4. Handoff freshness.
   - Start each session with `git status`, `git log -5`, latest tracking, and handoff.
   - Do not rely on stale prompt summaries when the repo has moved.

5. No edits in unknown dirty files.
   - If worktree is dirty, inspect diff before editing the same file.
   - Assume dirty changes belong to another agent or the user.

6. Audit scripts are first-class deliverables.
   - Each engine/data fix should include or update a read-only audit script that verifies the invariant.
   - Unit tests are not enough for Google Sheets data correctness.

7. Model downgrade gate.
   - Mini/Flash models are allowed for rename, pattern-based tests, docs/tracking, mechanical cleanup, and small UI that does not touch actions.
   - Mini/Flash models are not allowed for migration `--apply`, COGS/FIFO/MAC, auth/transactions, Sheets batch update, or historical reprocessing.

## E. Merge Gate

Before ending a work phase, regardless of agent:

- Tests pass: current baseline is 191+ tests.
- TypeScript: 0 errors. **Enforced automatically by Husky pre-commit hook** (`.husky/pre-commit` runs `tsc --noEmit`). Next.js SWC may compile code that strict tsc rejects, so the hook catches issues that `npm test` alone would miss.
- MAC drift audit: 0 mismatch.
- COGS drift audit: 0 mismatch or explicitly documented as informational.
- P&L MAC consistency audit: 0 delta when report/COGS changed.
- Current stock/order ledger/purchase ledger audits clean when related areas changed.
- Commit prefix:
  - `Claude <type>:`
  - `Codex <type>:`
  - `Antigravity <type>:`
- Do not push unless the user explicitly asks.

If the pre-commit hook blocks a commit that the agent believes should be allowed (e.g., WIP, intentional broken state for hand-off), use `git commit --no-verify` and note in the commit message. Do not make `--no-verify` a habit.

## F. Session Start Checklist

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` section 0 or `AGENTS.md`, depending on agent.
2. Read `DEVELOPMENT-TRACKING.md` 3 newest entries.
3. Read `docs/audits/codex-handoff-2026-06-25.md`.
4. Run `git status` and `git log -5`.
5. Pick a `[ ]` task and mark it in-progress with `[~C]`, `[~X]`, or `[~A]`.
6. Do the work.
7. Verify.
8. Commit.
9. Update tracking and handoff from `[~*]` to `[x]`, `[!]`, or `[-]`.

## G. Model Selection per Task Type

Pick the model tier that matches task complexity. Start lower, escalate if the agent gets stuck. Token cost scales with reasoning level — don't burn Pro High on trivial work.

### Codex (engine)

| Task type | Model | Reasoning | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mechanical 1-2 lines | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Low | Rename, delete nav link, constant change |
| Standard refactor + tests | `gpt-5.4` | Medium | 1-2 functions with pattern already in codebase |
| Multi-file refactor / logic | `gpt-5.5` | Medium | Cursor pagination, audit script with new logic |
| Architecture / schema / migration | `gpt-5.6-sol` | High | RPC design, RLS policies, migration with trigger |
| Debug investigation / drift | `gpt-5.6-sol` | High | Root cause analysis, race condition, data drift |
| Multi-agent agentic workflow | `gpt-5.6-sol` | Max or Ultra | Franchise spec, multi-tenant RLS design |
| Fast/cheap agentic batch | `gpt-5.6-luna` | Medium | Bulk edits, mechanical refactors across many files |

### Antigravity (UI)

| Task type | Model | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Mechanical 1-2 lines | `Gemini 3.5 Flash (Low)` | Rename label, delete redundant entry |
| Single component / small form | `Gemini 3.5 Flash (Medium)` | Form update, modal tweak |
| Multi-component page | `Gemini 3.5 Flash (High)` | New admin page with several sections |
| Design system consistency | `Gemini 3.1 Pro (Low)` | Apply design tokens across multiple files |
| Mobile-first complex / critical UI | `Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)` | POS mobile redesign, accessibility-critical flows |
| Free tier / bulk read-only | `GPT-OSS 120B (Medium)` | Summary tasks, doc reads (no production writes) |

### Claude (this agent)

Single model `GLM 5.1[1m]`. Used for coordination, review, planning, surgical fixes. Claude does not get delegated engine/UI implementation — that goes to Codex/Antigravity.

### Selection rules

- Match tier to risk: production migration → at least `gpt-5.6-sol` High. Trivial UI tweak → Flash Low.
- User explicitly approves model choice for high-cost tiers (`gpt-5.6-sol` Max/Ultra, `Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)`).
- If agent stuck at lower tier for >2 iterations, escalate one level.
- For long sessions (1+ hour), prefer mid-tier to conserve token budget.
- Codex `/model` and Antigravity `/model` commands show available tiers per project plan.

## H. Handoff Message Format

Khi Claude giao task cho Codex/Antigravity, output cho user copy-paste phải:

1. **1 dòng directive tiếng Việt, nói như người** — trong quotes, reference file handoff bằng backtick path. User copy nguyên câu quotes dán vào chat của agent.
   - ĐÚNG: `"Đọc và triển khai Task 3.4 theo \`docs/handoffs/2026-07-15-codex-task-3.4-outside-cohort-investigation.md\`, commit rồi chờ Claude review"`
   - SAI: "Pickup Task 3.4 — investigate 224 outside-cohort MAC mismatches (read-only)."
   - Tránh "Pickup", "execute", "process this task" — bureaucratic, không phải lời nói.
   - Không dùng `cat` command — agent tự mở file khi đọc.
2. **Model recommendation** — 1 dòng riêng bên dưới, kèm lý do ngắn, reference Section G.

### Template

```
Paste cho [Agent]:
"<câu directive tiếng Việt> theo `docs/handoffs/<file>.md`, commit rồi chờ Claude review"

Model: `<model>` `<reasoning>` — <lý do ngắn> (Section G).
```

### Ví dụ cụ thể

**Cho Codex (engine):**
```
Paste cho Codex:
"Đọc và triển khai Task 3.4 theo `docs/handoffs/2026-07-15-codex-task-3.4-outside-cohort-investigation.md`, commit rồi chờ Claude review"

Model: `gpt-5.6-sol` High — drift root cause investigation (Section G).
```

**Cho Antigravity (UI):**
```
Paste cho Antigravity:
"Đọc và triển khai UI-XX theo `docs/handoffs/2026-07-XX-antigravity-...md`, commit rồi chờ Claude review"

Model: `Gemini 3.5 Flash (Medium)` — single component form update (Section G).
```



- COGS valuation: MAC, pinned into `Order_Lines_V2.cost_at_sale`.
- Inventory quantity: `Stock_Ledger.quantity_change`.
- FIFO: audit/debug only, not the primary P&L contract.
- P&L MAC breakdown refactor: implemented by Codex in commits `a63f0b1` and `4bf795c`.
- P&L consistency audit: `scripts/audit-pnl-mac-consistency.ts`.

## I. Communication Style with Business Owner

**The user is the business owner, not a system builder.** All agents (Claude, Codex, Antigravity) must apply this rule to EVERY communication that reaches the user — whether direct chat response, paste message, status report, summary, or any artifact the user will read.

### Critical scope (apply to ALL agents, ALL user-facing output)

This rule applies whenever an agent's output will be read by the user:
- **Direct chat responses** from Claude to user
- **Paste messages** that user will copy to Codex/Antigravity (Pattern A in Section H)
- **Codex/Antigravity responses** that user will paste back to Claude or read directly
- **Status reports, summaries, audit results** presented to user
- **Vietnamese-facing parts** of any doc the user reads

When in doubt: translate to plain Vietnamese before showing to user. Technical English OK in code, audit reports, internal agent-to-agent communication. NOT OK when user is audience.

### Rules

1. **Plain Vietnamese by default.** No high-level tech jargon unless user asks deeper.
   - ĐÚNG: "Backup chạy mỗi ngày 02:30, file lưu 30 ngày rồi tự xóa."
   - SAI: "pg_cron schedule triggers Apps Script pull-model endpoint with 30-day rolling retention."

2. **Explain when asked, not before.** Don't preempt with technical detail unless user requests depth. If user asks "why?" or "explain deeper", THEN use technical terms freely, but always define on first use.

3. **Translate tech issues to business impact.** When a technical issue blocks work, frame in business terms:
   - ĐÚNG: "Backup hiện lỗi vì Google chặn kiểu kết nối đó — cần đổi cách. Có 3 lựa chọn với đánh đổi X/Y/Z."
   - SAI: "403 storageQuotaExceeded — SA has no quota in My Drive, need OAuth delegation or Workspace."

4. **Decisions belong to user — but only business decisions.** Escalate to the user only for business-impact calls: priorities, scope, risk/time tradeoffs, anything touching real data or money, irreversible actions. For pure technical/implementation choices (which file to fix, how to phrase a script fix, which internal doc to update), agents decide using best judgment, act, then report in plain language what was done and why. Do not ask the user to approve routine technical execution. If a technical choice is unusually good or worth the user learning from, proactively point it out with the reasoning when reporting — don't withhold it, just don't gate the work behind it.
   - User explicit feedback 2026-07-17: "Anh không hiểu kỹ thuật sâu... những việc liên quan đến kỹ thuật anh cần em dùng ngôn ngữ dễ hiểu để anh biết em dùng cái đó làm gì... còn lại đều có thể nghe theo em khuyến nghị." User is an end-user of the product, not a developer; wants technical execution decided by agents, not gated on approval.
   - Note: this is separate from the CLI's own tool-permission prompts (e.g., "This command requires approval" before running a shell command). Those come from the user's Claude Code permission-mode settings, not from an agent's question — agents cannot suppress them. If the user wants fewer of those, they adjust their own permission mode; agents should explain this distinction rather than let the user think an agent is the one asking.

5. **Code in English, communication in Vietnamese.** Per existing protocol — code/comments English, user-facing text Vietnamese. Apply same to chat with user.

6. **Audit docs and policy docs**: English for technical detail (audience = future devs/agents). Add plain Vietnamese summary at top if user will read directly.

7. **Agent → user translation layer (Claude's job)**: When Codex/Antigravity sends a technical response, Claude MUST translate to plain Vietnamese before showing to user. Don't copy-paste raw technical content. Don't forward commit SHAs, file paths, or technical identifiers unless user explicitly asked for them.

### Why

User has explicitly stated they are the business owner, not a developer. They make business decisions based on agent recommendations. Tech jargon creates barrier to decision-making. Plain language = better decisions, fewer miscommunications, faster sessions.

User explicit feedback 2026-07-17: "em vẫn chưa dùng cách nói phù hợp với người dùng enduser như anh" — communication still too technical even after Section I added. Strengthen rule.

### How to apply

| Output type | Language | Style |
|---|---|---|
| Chat response to user | Vietnamese | Plain, business framing, no jargon |
| Paste message for agent (user copies) | Vietnamese | Plain directive (Pattern A per Section H) |
| Codex/Antigravity response to user | **Vietnamese, translated by Claude** | Claude translates raw technical response → plain Vietnamese before showing |
| Commit message | English | Per existing protocol |
| Code + comments | English | Per existing protocol |
| Audit / investigation report | English | Technical, for devs/agents |
| Policy doc user reads | Vietnamese summary + English detail | Plain top, technical bottom |
| Tracking entries | Mixed OK | English facts, Vietnamese context |

### Drift trigger

If user asks "what does X mean?" more than once in a session, says "anh nghĩ cần trao đổi trực tiếp với [agent]", or says "em vẫn chưa dùng cách nói phù hợp" — communication style is drifting technical. **STOP, reset to plain language, translate any pending technical content.**

### Specific words to avoid (use plain alternative)

| Avoid | Use instead |
|---|---|
| endpoint | đường dẫn / cổng truy cập |
| middleware | lớp bảo vệ / bỏ qua |
| commit / SHA | lần lưu thay đổi / phiên bản |
| push | đưa lên mạng / đưa lên GitHub |
| Codex / Antigravity | đội kiểm tra / đội giao diện |
| Phase 0 / containment | bước đầu bảo vệ / khóa nguy hiểm |
| P0 exposure | lỗ hổng nghiêm trọng |
| deprecated | lỗi thời / không còn dùng |
| adapter | bộ kết nối |
| grep | tìm kiếm |
| TS clean / build pass | code chạy OK, không lỗi |
| regression | hỏng sau khi sửa |
| refactor | cấu trúc lại |
| migration | cập nhật cấu trúc dữ liệu |

When forced to use a technical term, **always** define on first use in same response.

## Change Log

- 2026-07-17 Claude: Section I rule 4 narrowed — agents escalate only business-impact decisions to the user; technical/implementation choices are decided by agents and reported in plain language, not gated on approval. Clarified that CLI tool-permission prompts are a separate, user-controlled setting, not an agent asking a question.
- 2026-07-17 Codex: refreshed Section A for the approved ten-document canonical entry set and three-tier authority model. Specialist MAC/backup/domain sources remain supporting authority; audits/handoffs/completed plans remain historical evidence. Pending Claude protocol review.
- 2026-07-17 Claude: Strengthened Section I "Communication Style with Business Owner" per user explicit feedback. Rule now applies to ALL agents (Codex/Antigravity/Claude) for ALL user-facing output. Added rule 7 (Claude translates technical agent responses → plain Vietnamese before showing user). Added word-to-avoid table with plain alternatives. Drift trigger expanded to include user complaint "em vẫn chưa dùng cách nói phù hợp".
- 2026-07-16 Codex+Claude: Stabilization Phase 2 closed. Added "Backup Files" subsection to Section C — Codex owns backup architecture (`supabase/functions/backup-to-drive/**`, `scripts/apps-script/backup-to-drive.gs`, `lib/drive-backup*.ts`, retention/schema decisions, restore planning, R2/B2 migration trigger). Claude retains final architecture/policy approval + protocol ownership. Any production restore still requires reviewed dry-run/apply plan.
- 2026-07-16 Claude: added Section I "Communication Style with Business Owner" per explicit user directive (strengthened 2026-07-17 above).
- 2026-07-13 Claude: added Section G "Model Selection per Task Type" with Codex/Antigravity/Claude matrix. Updated agent lineup with available model tiers.
- 2026-07-10 Claude: consolidated to single ROADMAP.md + COMPLETED.md. Removed per-agent roadmaps.
- 2026-06-26 Codex: rewrote protocol for 3-agent coordination and risk-boundary ownership.
