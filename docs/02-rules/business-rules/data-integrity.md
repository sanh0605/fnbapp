# Data integrity: backdated, audit/recovery, and backup rules

## Backdated transaction rules

### BR-BACKDATE-001 — Creation time and effective time are distinct

**Status:** `APPROVED`

A purchase, stock adjustment, or production event created later with an earlier effective time is a backdated event. Detection must preserve both timestamps and the affected historical window.

### BR-BACKDATE-002 — Backdated impact requires review

**Status:** `APPROVED`

Detected events follow the reviewed backdated-ledger path. The system must not silently recompute pinned historical sales merely because a new ledger row becomes visible in replay.

### BR-BACKDATE-003 — Historical gaps remain evidence

**Status:** `APPROVED`

Known historical gaps may be locked/classified without changing `cost_at_sale`. Operator review and any future recompute decision remain separate actions.

## Audit, recovery, and production-write rules

### BR-DATA-001 — No silent production writes

**Status:** `APPROVED`

Inspection and audit are read-only by default. Any tool capable of writing must require an explicit apply mode and print the exact target/count/payload before execution.

### BR-DATA-002 — Historical recovery requires immutable inputs

**Status:** `APPROVED`

A historical recovery requires owner approval, frozen source/payload hash, dry-run output, atomic apply, post-apply cohort checks, and rollback-ready evidence.

### BR-DATA-003 — Audit locks protect reviewed history

**Status:** `APPROVED`

Rows protected by `audit_baseline_locks` reject ordinary mutation. Any escape path must be narrow, transaction-local, reviewed, and recorded.

### BR-DATA-004 — Failure means stop and assess

**Status:** `APPROVED`

If a post-apply invariant fails, stop further writes and compare against the approved cohort before deciding whether rollback is necessary. A broad live audit that changes population is not by itself proof that the approved cohort failed.

## Backup and retention rules

### BR-BACKUP-001 — Scheduled backups are full snapshots

**Status:** `APPROVED`

The Drive backup is a full schema-versioned snapshot of the approved table allowlist, not only the day's new rows.

### BR-BACKUP-002 — Daily and monthly retention are separate

**Status:** `APPROVED`

Keep 180 rolling daily snapshots. Keep one idempotent full snapshot for each month indefinitely. Daily and monthly files live in separate Drive child folders.

### BR-BACKUP-003 — Completeness is validated before retention

**Status:** `APPROVED`

Apps Script validates the response, schema version, and expected table keys before writing/retaining the file. A response file that fails the contract is not a successful backup.

### BR-BACKUP-004 — Storage migration uses capacity/reliability triggers

**Status:** `APPROVED`

Begin migration planning when the serialized bundle reaches the warning threshold in the backup policy (currently 20 MB), and move the production destination by 25 MB or earlier if runtime/reliability limits are reached.

### BR-BACKUP-005 — Restore requires separate approval

**Status:** `APPROVED`

Backup success does not authorize restoration. A restore needs a reviewed mapping, target environment, dry-run/validation, and explicit production approval.
